## What is the Body Mass Index

The body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of an individual. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height.

The equation is:

$$BMI = {703 \times {weight} \over {height^2}}.$$

Where weight is in pounds and height is in inches.

* Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater
