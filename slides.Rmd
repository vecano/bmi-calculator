## What is the Body Mass Index

      The body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of an individual. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height.

The equation is:

  $$BMI = 703 \\times \\frac{weight}{height^2}$$

Where weight is in pounds and height is in inches.
